# Bonsai Launchpad Uni v4 Hooks

Hooks to use with Uniswap V4 and the Bonsai Launchpad.

## Contracts

### DefaultSettings

Base Sepolia deployment: 0x44848340f8E663FB569568dfA4cFd345fBeAa38A

This is the hook that will be applied to all pools created from the launchpad with the following effect(s):

1. It sets a dynamic swap fee based on how many Bonsai NFTs you hold.

### DefaultHook

Base Sepolia deployment: 0xA788031C591B6824c032a0EFe74837EE5eaeC080

Wraps the default settings into a uniswap v4 hook

## Make your hook eligible

You can create your own hook and submit it to be whitelisted for the launchpad. In order to be eligible it must be open source, verified on the zkSync explorer and it must include a call to the Default Settings contract for fee adjustment based on Bonsai NFT ownership.

1. In order to make the fee adjustment the `beforeSwap` flag must be enabled on your contract:

```solidity
   function getHookPermissions() public pure override returns (Hooks.Permissions memory) {
      return Hooks.Permissions({
         ...
         beforeSwap: true,
         ...
      });
   }
```

2. Next make a call to the `DefaultSettings` contract deployment with the `sender` param as the argument in your `beforeSwap` function to get the appropriate return value for the fee param:

```solidity
   function beforeSwap(address sender, PoolKey calldata key, IPoolManager.SwapParams calldata params, bytes calldata)
      external
      override
      returns (bytes4, BeforeSwapDelta, uint24)
   {
      // override swap fee by making a call to the DefaultSettings contract
      uint24 protocolFeePercentage = defaultSettings.beforeSwapFeeOverride(sender);

      // The protocol fee will be applied as part of the LP fees in the PoolManager
      return (BaseHook.beforeSwap.selector, BeforeSwapDeltaLibrary.ZERO_DELTA, protocolFeePercentage);
   }
```

See the full example in `DefaultHook.sol`.

# v4-template

### **A template for writing Uniswap v4 Hooks 🦄**

[`Use this Template`](https://github.com/uniswapfoundation/v4-template/generate)

1. The example hook [Counter.sol](src/Counter.sol) demonstrates the `beforeSwap()` and `afterSwap()` hooks
2. The test template [Counter.t.sol](test/Counter.t.sol) preconfigures the v4 pool manager, test tokens, and test liquidity.

<summary>Updating to v4-template:latest</summary>

This template is actively maintained -- you can update the v4 dependencies, scripts, and helpers:

```bash
git remote add template https://github.com/uniswapfoundation/v4-template
git fetch template
git merge template/main <BRANCH> --allow-unrelated-histories
```

### Check Forge Installation

_Ensure that you have correctly installed Foundry (Forge) and that it's up to date. You can update Foundry by running:_

```
foundryup
```

## Set up

_requires [foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh)_

```
forge install
forge test
```

### Local Development (Anvil)

Other than writing unit tests (recommended!), you can only deploy & test hooks on [anvil](https://book.getfoundry.sh/anvil/)

```bash
# start anvil, a local EVM chain
anvil

# in a new terminal
forge script script/Anvil.s.sol \
    --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 \
    --private-key 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80 \
    --broadcast
```

See [script/](script/) for hook deployment, pool creation, liquidity provision, and swapping.

<summary><h2>Troubleshooting</h2></summary>

### _Permission Denied_

When installing dependencies with `forge install`, Github may throw a `Permission Denied` error

Typically caused by missing Github SSH keys, and can be resolved by following the steps [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)

Or [adding the keys to your ssh-agent](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#adding-your-ssh-key-to-the-ssh-agent), if you have already uploaded SSH keys

### Hook deployment failures

Hook deployment failures are caused by incorrect flags or incorrect salt mining

1. Verify the flags are in agreement:
   - `getHookCalls()` returns the correct flags
   - `flags` provided to `HookMiner.find(...)`
2. Verify salt mining is correct:
   - In **forge test**: the _deployer_ for: `new Hook{salt: salt}(...)` and `HookMiner.find(deployer, ...)` are the same. This will be `address(this)`. If using `vm.prank`, the deployer will be the pranking address
   - In **forge script**: the deployer must be the CREATE2 Proxy: `0x4e59b44847b379578588920cA78FbF26c0B4956C`
     - If anvil does not have the CREATE2 deployer, your foundry may be out of date. You can update it with `foundryup`
